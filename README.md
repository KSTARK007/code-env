# Encryption part
All the files are encrypted and decrypted, using a symmetric cipher.

Hashes contain dynamic keys driven by user to enhance security.

Operating system interface and System specific parameters were used accordingly. 

In this the Cipher used is AES and hash used is MD5. 

## Important:

- Save and Run the code in a seperate directory. It should not effect our work flow. 

- key should be defined in the file itself.

- pip install pycrypto 
before 

In this script, the code is devised for the single encryption and single decryption.
